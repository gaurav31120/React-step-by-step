--------------------------------------

Why Should You Update Your React Version?
Upgrading your React project ensures:

Better performance
Access to new features and functionalities
Bug fixes and improved stability


As of now:
Current Stable Version: 18.3.1

React 19 (RC): React 19 is in Release Candidate (RC) phase. That means it’s almost ready for final release but available for early use.



Check Your Current React Version
To see what version of React you’re currently using:

Open your project folder.
Open the package.json file.
Look under the "dependencies" section:
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
}


18 = Major release

3 = Minor update

1 = Patch (bug fixes)



How to Upgrade to React 19 (RC)


Open your terminal in your project root.

Run this command to install the RC version:

npm install react@rc react-dom@rc
This will install the Release Candidate versions of both react and react-dom.

We can use this command also to install latest version of react and react dom:
npm install --save-exact react@rc react-dom@rc

Test Your Project
After upgrading, test if everything works fine:

npm run dev
