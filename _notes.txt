1 How React Works:
You can write HTML code inside JavaScript using JSX.
React renders everything properly in the browser.


2 Why Should Component Names Start With a Capital Letter?
Because React treats lowercase tags like HTML elements (e.g., <div>, <h1>), and uppercase tags as custom React components.


3 Return Must Have a Single Parent Tag
All JSX returned by a component must be wrapped inside a single parent element like a <div> or a fragment <> </>.

4 Library vs Framework
Library: You control the flow (e.g., React).
Framework: The framework controls the flow; you just follow its structure (e.g., Angular).
