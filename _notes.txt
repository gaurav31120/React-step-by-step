1 What is React JS
React is JavaScript Library
Use to make web front-end application
With React we make SPA (Single Page Application)
Example: Facebook = SPA | NASA’s website = Multi-page app.

2 Why Learn React?
Fast because of virtual DOM
Easy to learn
Learning curve is also less compare other UI technology.
Hight demand and a lots of Job in market.
Large community

3 More About React
Develop by Facebook
Current version is 18.3.1
RC version 19
After React you can easily learn React Native also for mobile development

4 React software installation and setup

Install Node.js
Go to nodejs.org
Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version
Complete the installation


Verify installation:
Open your terminal and run:

node -v
npm -v


Install VS Code
Download from code.visualstudio.com

This is where you’ll write and run all your React code.



Install Vite
Why Vite?
Officially recommended by React docs
Super fast dev server 🚀
Cleaner build process
Supports TypeScript, CSS modules, pre-processors, and more!


Go to vite.dev



Install Vite via Terminal:

npm create vite@latest


Follow the prompts:
Project Name – Type your desired project name
Select Framework – Choose React
Variant – Select JavaScript
Hit Enter!


Install Node Modules


Once Vite setup is done, run:

npm install


Open Project in VS Code

code .
This opens your project directly in VS Code.



Run the React App

npm run dev
Your project should now run on localhost:5173 (Vite’s default port).


-----------------------------------------------------

5 How React Works:
You can write HTML code inside JavaScript using JSX.
React renders everything properly in the browser.


6 Why Should Component Names Start With a Capital Letter?
Because React treats lowercase tags like HTML elements (e.g., <div>, <h1>), and uppercase tags as custom React components.


7 Return Must Have a Single Parent Tag
All JSX returned by a component must be wrapped inside a single parent element like a <div> or a fragment <> </>.

8 Library vs Framework
Library: You control the flow (e.g., React).
Framework: The framework controls the flow; you just follow its structure (e.g., Angular).

9 Most important file in a React project
It contains:

Project name, version, and metadata
Build commands and scripts
Dependencies and devDependencies

10 Difference Between Dependencies and DevDependencies

Dependencies
Required for running the project (e.g., React, ReactDOM)
dependencies --> dependencies wo library hoti jinke upar aapka project run karta hai.



DevDependencies
Required only during development (e.g., ESLint, Vite, Babel)
These packages are downloaded and stored inside the node_modules folder.
dev-dependencies --> development dependencies --> jinki wajah se aap development kar pa rahe ho

11 package-json vs package-lock.json
package-json --> project ki details hoti hain
not exact version

package-lock.json --> project ki nested details hoti hain

It stores the exact version of each installed dependency.
Contains a nested structure of dependencies.
Helps ensure consistent installs across different machines.

12 README.md
A documentation file about your project.
Commonly includes:
Project purpose
How to install and run
Author info, etc.

13 vite.config.js
Contains configuration settings for Vite (the build tool).
Used to set aliases, plugins, ports, etc.

14 eslint.config.js
Contains ESLint rules (JavaScript code standards)
Helps with code quality and linting

15 .gitignore
Lists files and folders that should not be pushed to Git (e.g., node_modules, .env, dist, etc.)

16 Project Files Overview

index.html
Browser's entry point (root <div> is here)

main.jsx	
React/JS entry point; renders the <App /> component

App.jsx
Main React component

App.css, index.css
Styling files for components and global styles

Best Practices
Create React components inside the src/components folder
If something is meant for public access (like images, favicon, etc.), use the public folder.
For assets used internally (like logos, icons, CSS files), use an assets folder inside src.

node_modules
Contains all installed libraries and packages
Automatically created when you run npm install or yarn install


17 Why Should You Not Push node_modules to Git?
It is very large in size
Other developers can simply run npm install to recreate it from package.json

18 What is a Component?
In React, a component is a small, reusable part of the UI (User Interface).

Think of a component as a building block of your app.

Example:
If your project is a car, its components would be:

Tyres

Engine

Doors

Gearbox



Similarly, in a React project:
The header, button, footer, or form field can be components.



19 Nested Components
A component can contain other smaller components inside it.

For example: A Form component may include an Input component and a Button component



20 Role of Components in React
Every part of the UI in React is made using components.
Components can be reused throughout the app.
They make the code modular, readable, and easy to maintain.


Rules for Writing Components
Always start component names with a Capital Letter.
Components must return a single parent tag.
Use <div>...</div> or <>...</> (React Fragment).


You can use a component like an HTML tag:
<Fruit />
<Color></Color>

21 Component vs Normal Function
Normal Function
Can start with lowercase
Executes JavaScript logic
Called like myFunction()
Any data type


22 React Component
Must start with a Capital Letter
Returns JSX (UI)
Used like <MyComponent />
Returns JSX (HTML-like)


23 Why export/import components?
We should not create all components in a single file.
If we want to use a component in other files, we must export it.
To use an exported component, we need to import it in the file where we want to use it.


Example Use Case
If you create an Image component, you can reuse it in multiple places like:

Profile picture
Post section
Navbar
Dropdown


This keeps your code modular and reusable.

24 Default Export
You can export only one default per file.
Import it without curly braces.
jsx
CopyEdit
// Export
export default Login;

// Import
import Login from "./UserComponent.jsx";

25 Named Export
You can export multiple values from a single file using named exports.

jsx
CopyEdit
// Export
export function Profile() {
  return <h1>Profile</h1>;
}

export function Setting() {
  return <h1>Setting</h1>;
}
jsx
CopyEdit
// Import
import { Profile, Setting } from "./UserComponent.jsx";

26 Both Default and Named Exports in One File
jsx
CopyEdit
function Login() {
  return <h1>Login User</h1>;
}

export function Profile() {
  return <h1>Profile</h1>;
}

export function Setting() {
  return <h1>Setting</h1>;
}

export default Login;
jsx
CopyEdit
// Import in App.jsx
import Login, { Profile, Setting } from "./UserComponent.jsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Importing and Exporting Components</h1>
      <Login />
      <Profile />
      <Setting />
    </div>
  );
}

27 Exporting and Importing Variables
You can also export variables (like keys, constants):

jsx
CopyEdit
// UserComponent.jsx
export const UserKey = "@#$#@$#@#$@#";
jsx
CopyEdit
// App.jsx
import Login, { Profile, Setting, UserKey } from "./UserComponent.jsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Importing and Exporting Components</h1>
      <Login />
      <Profile />
      <Setting />
      <h2>{UserKey}</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

28 Default Export
Syntax : export default ComponentName

Import Syntax: import ComponentName from "file"

29 Named Export
Syntax : export { ComponentName } or export const

Import Syntax : import { ComponentName } from "file"

30 Combined Export
Syntax : Default + Named

Import Syntax :import Default, { Named1, Named2 }

31 JSX in React

What is JSX?
It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files.

Why use JSX?
JSX makes it easier and cleaner to create React elements and build the UI.

Without JSX: HTML and JavaScript are written separately.
With JSX: You can write both together in the same file.

JSX Full Form
There’s often some confusion about what JSX stands for. Some say it means JavaScript Extension, while others believe it's JavaScript XML. However, there is no official full form of JSX mentioned on the React official website — it’s just a syntax extension used to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.

32 Click Event and Function call

Difference Between JavaScript and React Function Calls
HTML Example:

<h1>Gaurav Kumar Todos</h1>
    <img
      src="https://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2018/4/10/1/HBFB1406_180126_dog-on-rug_041.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.822.suffix/1523383802334.jpeg"
      alt="Anil Sidhu"
      class="photo"
    />

    <ul>
      <li>Invent the traffic light</li>
      <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
      <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
    </ul>

    <button onclick="callFun()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
      function callFun() {
        alert("function called");
      }
    </script>


The Same Code Won’t Work in React JSX
function App() {
  function callFun() {
    alert("Function called");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onclick="callFun()">Click Me</button> {/* ❌ Wrong */}
    </div>
  );
}


Correct Way to Use onClick in React JSX
function App() {
  function callFun() {
    alert("Function called");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={callFun}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}


33 Important JSX Rules:
Use camelCase: onClick instead of onclick.
Don’t use quotes "": JSX treats quoted functions as strings.
Do not call the function immediately using (). Just pass the reference like onClick={callFun}.

34 Using Arrow Functions in JSX
You can also use arrow functions instead of normal functions:

function App() {
  const fruits = () => {
    alert("Apple");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={fruits}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
}


Passing Parameters to Functions in JSX
If you want to pass parameters, you must use an inline arrow function:

function App() {
  const fruits = (name) => {
    alert(name);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => fruits("Apple")}>Apple</button>
      <button onClick={() => fruits("Banana")}>Banana</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Use Arrow Functions
Because onClick={fruits("Apple")} will call the function immediately, not on click. Using onClick={() => fruits("Apple")} ensures the function runs only when the button is clicked.
